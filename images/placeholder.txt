You'll need to create icon files with the following names and sizes:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
2. icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
3. icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons should be in PNG format with transparent backgrounds.

You can create these icons using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools.

For a quick solution, you could use emoji or currency symbols (Â£ and $) with a green/blue background to represent the GBP/USD pair.
